                  Init containers are executed in order prior to containers being
                  started. If any init container fails, the pod is considered to have
                  failed and is handled according to its restartPolicy. The name for
                  an init container or normal container must be unique among all containers.
                  Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes,
                  Liveness probes, or Startup probes. The resourceRequirements of
                  an init container are taken into account during scheduling by finding
                  the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using
                  the max of of that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits
                  are applied to init containers in a similar fashion. Init containers
